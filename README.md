# tessian-platform-interview-challenge

## Description

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to containerise an application
we have created for you and host it in AWS with a TLS endpoint.

Specifically, you need to:

- Add a Dockerfile for the application in `src/`
- Write terraform code to create AWS infrastructure which:
   - Runs the container workload (we recommend ECS)
   - Exposes the application to the internet over HTTPS in some way

Please be mindful of AWS costs! We don't want you to run up a bill. It is
possible with free-tier resources but you may use some low cost resources if
you wish.

## Application

The application is a Python mock REST API for emails. It uses
[poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) for dependency management. In case
you're not familiar, poetry takes care of python virtualenvs to avoid dependency
conflicts, and it locks the dependency tree with `poetry.lock` to provide
repeatable builds. The app should have it's dependencies installed with `poetry
install` run from the `src/` folder.

If you'd like to try the app outside of a container first, run:

```
cd src
poetry install
poetry run python manage.py makemigrations
poetry run python manage.py migrate
poetry run python manage.py runserver
```

Then point your browser at http://localhost:8000/
